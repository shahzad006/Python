# 🧑‍🍳 Introduction to Functions  

Think of a **function** like a **recipe** in cooking:  

- If a chef has to cook the same dish again and again, instead of writing all steps every time, he just keeps the recipe ready and uses it whenever needed.  
- In Python, a **function** works the same way: you write code once, and then call (use) it whenever you want.

## ✅ Benefits of Functions  

1. **Reusability** ♻️  
   - Write code once, use it many times.  

2. **Clean & Organized Code** ✨  
   - Functions break code into small parts, making it easier to read and manage.  

3. **Fewer Errors** 🛡️  
   - Since you don’t rewrite the same thing again and again, there are fewer chances of mistakes.

## ⚙️ How Functions Work  

A function has:  
- **Input** → what you give  
- **Process** → what the function does  
- **Output** → what you get  

👉 Example:  
A **juicer machine** 🍊 
- Input: Fruit  
- Process: Juicing  
- Output: Juice

## 🔹 Python Built-in Functions  

Python already has many ready-made functions.  

### 1. `len()` → Length of object  
### 2. `print()`→ Displays text or values on the screen.
### 3. `type() ` → Tells the type of a variable.
### 4. `input()`→ Takes input from the user.
### 5. `max() & min() `→ Finds the largest or smallest value.
### 6. `sum()`→ Adds all numbers in a list.
### 7. `round()`→ Rounds a number to nearest integer.
### 8. `sorted()`→ Sorts a list in order.
### 9. `abs()`→ Gives the absolute value (no negative sign).
### 10. `help()`→ Shows documentation/help about Python objects.

✅ These are more powerful built-in functions.
